# Lung Analyzer

This is a web application built with Flask in order to 
- construct and display charts to show the likelihood that an individual may have lung cancer
- take in biological factors for individuals and use a logistic regression model to determine the likelihood that they may have lung cancer.

To run the application, install the requirements found in `requirements.txt` (which can be done by doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`) and run `python app.py`. This will host the Flask application at localhost:5000.
